            <div id="paragraph">
                1892–1959 – The club was founded in 1892 following a split from Everton F.C.
                and joined the Football League in 1893. The appointment of Tom Watson as manager resulted in the club's first
                successful period, in which they won two League Championships. Two League Championships were won in the 1920s
                and a further one was won in 1947. Following the club's fortunes declined and they were relegated to the Second
                Division in 1954.

            <div id="paragraph">
                1959–85 – Bill Shankly was appointed as manager in 1959 and guided the club back
                into the First Division. Shankly's arrival laid the foundations for the club's success in the 1970s and 80s
                domestically and in European competition, as the club won numerous League Championships and four European Cups.

            <div id="paragraph">
                1985–present – Following the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985, English clubs were
                banned from European competitions until 1991. The club was still successful domestically winning three League
                Championships during this period. The 1990s saw a lack of success for the club as they struggled to repeat their
                success in the Premier League era. The club reached former heights in 2005 when they won the UEFA Champions League
                (formerly known as the European Cup) for a fifth time.
